# Roadmap

Ixia-C is released periodically.  This page does NOT list all the minor/bug-fix releases that are planned.

The next major release of Ixia-C will be version 0.1.0.  This release will align to v0.4.0 of the [Open Traffic Generator Data Models](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models).  The biggest feature in this release will be the ability to disable packet instrumentation.  This change WILL BE backwards incompatible.
