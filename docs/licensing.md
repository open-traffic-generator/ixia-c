 The **Ixia-c Traffic Port Capacity** is determined as a sum of the configured Ixia-c software test port speeds with the possible values of: 100GE, 50GE, 40GE, 25GE, 10GE, and 1GE. The Maximum data plane performance of an Ixia-c port may be less than the configured port speed, depending on the capabilities of the underlying hardware and software drivers. Doesn't apply to the UHD400T and IxOS hardware.

 The **Test seat concurrency** applies to a number of controller instances that are running with a configuration that exceeds the capabilities of the Community Edition.

 The **Restricted** protocol scale supports the maximum of 4 BGP sessions per test.

 The Capabilities of the **Limited** protocol scale depend on the protocol. For details, contact [Keysight Support](https://support.ixiacom.com/contact/support).

 Keysight Elastic Network Generator can simultaneously consume multiple licenses to increase the capabilities of a test. For example, if the Ixia-c Traffic Port Capacity configured in one test is 100GE, two Developer licenses will be consumed if available.

 If you require capabilities beyond those provided by the Community Edition, use [Keysight Elastic Network Generator](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/products/network-test/protocol-load-test/keysight-elastic-network-generator.html) product page to request an evaluation or a quote.

## License Server

In order to use capabilities of Elastic Network Generator that require a valid license, you need to deploy a Keysight License Server. Keysight uses the license server to manage floating or network shared licenses for its software products. The license server enables licenses to float and not be tied to a specific Elastic Network Generator instance. The Elastic Network Generator controllers must be able to reach the License server.

### Deployment

The license server is a virtual machine and it is distributed as OVA and QCOW2 images (you only need one of them depending on your hypervisor, downloading may need credentials for support website.).

* [OVA image](https://downloads.ixiacom.com/support/downloads_and_updates/public/KENG-License-Server-VM/4.4.0/4.4.0-202/slum-4.4.0-202.ova), 5.8GB
* [QCOW2 image](https://downloads.ixiacom.com/support/downloads_and_updates/public/KENG-License-Server-VM/4.4.0/4.4.0-202/slum-4.4.0-202.qcow2), 6GB

To make a decision where to deploy the License Server VM, take into the account the following requirements:

* For VMware ESXi, use the OVA image
* For Linux-based QEMU or KVM, use the QCOW2 image
* 2 vCPU cores
* 8GB RAM for ESXi, 4GB RAM for QEMU/KVM
* 100GB storage
* 1 vNIC for network connectivity. Note that DHCP is the preferred option, and this is also how the VM is configured to obtain its IP address.

Network connectivity requirements for the License Server VM

1. Internet access from the VM over HTTPS is desirable for online license activation, but not strictly required. Offline activation method is available as well.
2. Access from a user over HTTPS (TCP/443) for license operations (activation, deactivation, reservation, sync).
3. Access from any `keng-controller` that needs a license during a test run over gRPC (TCP/7443) for license checkout and check-in.

Here is an example of how different components communicate with the License Server:

### Configuration

If your network doesn't provide DHCP, you can configure a static IP address for the License Server VM. Access the VM console and go through two-step login process:

* First prompt: `console` (no password)
* Second promt: `admin`/`admin`
* Run the following commands to configure a static IP address, where `x.x.x.x` is the IP address, `yy` is the prefix length, `z.z.z.z` is the default gateway, `a.a.a.a` and `b.b.b.b` are DNS servers:

```Shell
kcos networking ip set mgmt0 x.x.x.x/yy z.z.z.z
kcos networking dns-servers add a.a.a.a b.b.b.b
```

### Activation

Now you shall be able to activate licenses and use the License Server with your Elastic Network Generator environments. Go to `https://your-license-server-hostname` to access the application. Enter credentials: `admin`/`admin` to login.

If you have an activation code, to perform an online activation, click "Activate Licenses", enter the code and click "Activate". For offline mode, choose "Offline Operations" instead.

You can also use a command-line session, via console or SSH, to perform license operations. Run `kcos licensing --help` to see the list of available commands.

## Using Licenses

To use the licenses with the Elastic Network Generator, provide the location of the license servers to the controller instances using

```
--license-servers="server1 server2 server3 server4"
```

argument when launching the controller. The argument accepts a space-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses of the License Servers, up to four. The controller will try to connect to the License Servers in the order they are specified in the list. If the first License Server is not available, or doesn't have enough available licenses to run the test, the controller will try to connect to the next one in the list.

An alternative way is to use an environment variable `LICENSE_SERVERS`.
