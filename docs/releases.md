# Release Features(s)

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for BGP/BGP+ over ISIS Simulated Topology. [More Details](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models/pull/327)
  ```go
    loopback = simRtr.Ipv4Loopbacks().
                Add().
                SetName("IPv4Loopback").
                SetAddress(dutIPv4).
                SetEthName(simRtr.Ethernets().Items()[0].Name())
    simRtrBgp= simRtr.Bgp().
            SetRouterId(loopback.Address())
    simRtrBgpIntf = simRtrBgp.Ipv4Interfaces().Add().
            SetIpv4Name(loopback.Name())
    simRtrBgpIntf.Peers().Add().
            SetAsNumber(1111).
            SetAsType(gosnappi.BgpV4PeerAsType.EBGP).
            SetPeerAddress(fromPeerIp).
            SetName("BgpPeer1")
  ```
  Note: For configuration of simulated topology please refer [here](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/ixia-c/releases/tag/v1.16.0-2).

* <b><i>Ixia-C, Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for GRE header in traffic flows.
  ```go
    flow1 := config.Flows().Add()
    ...
    gre := flow1.Packet().Add().Gre()
    ...
  ```
  Note: By default the correct GRE Protocol value will be set automatically depending on next header eg. IPv4/v6.

	
### Bug Fix(s)
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Issue is fixed where fetching ISIS learned information using `get_states` would sometimes fail with a error <i>Cannot clear data while transfer is in progress - data would be inconsistent</i>.

* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Issue is fixed where ARP/ND resolution was failing for LAG configurations with a mix of Loopback and connected interfaces.

* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Issue is fixed where on fetching BGP/BGP+ learned prefix information using `get_states` would return an incorrect prefix in certain scenarios. This was more likely to happen for IPv6 prefixes.

* <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400</i></b>: Issue is fixed where if the DHCPv6 client type is configured as IANAPD, DHCPv6 Server `get_states` doesn't show IAPD addresses.

* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: Issue is fixed where Auto MAC resolution was not working properly for multinic scenarios such as LAG, resulting in flows being transmitted with dest MAC as 00:00:00:00:00:00 and DUT not forwarding these packets.


#### Known Issues
* <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400</i></b>: When DHCPv6 Server is configured with multiple pools, The DHCPv6 clients are not accepting addresses from different pools.
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: If `keng-layer23-hw-server` version is upgraded/downgraded, the ports which will be used from this container must be rebooted once before running the tests.
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: `StartProtocols`/`set_control_state.protocol.all.start` can get stuck till the time all DHPCv4/v6 clients receive the leased IPv4/v6 addresses from the DHCPv4/v6 server/relay agent. This may result in getting `"context deadline exceeded"` error in the test program.
* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: Packets will not be transmitted if `flows[i].rate.pps` is less than 50.
* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: `values` for fields in flow packet headers can be created with maximum length of 1000 values. If larger set of values are required for a field which are random, please use `random` instead of `values`.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Flow Tx is incremented for flow with tx endpoints as LAG, even if no packets are sent on the wire when all active links of the LAG are down. 
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

# Release Features(s)

* <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400</i></b>: Support added for DHCPv6 Client and Server in control plane.
  - User will be the able to configure DHCPv6 Client and Server by the following code snippet.
  ```go
    // Configure a DHCP Client
      dhcpv6client := d1Eth1.Dhcpv6Interfaces().Add().
        SetName("p1d1dhcpv61")

      dhcpv6client.IaType().Iata()
      dhcpv6client.DuidType().Llt()

      // Configure a DHCPv6 Server
      d1Dhcpv6Server := d2.DhcpServer().Ipv6Interfaces().Add().
        SetName("p2d1Dhcpv6Server1").

      d1Dhcpv6ServerPool := d1Dhcpv6Server.SetIpv6Name("p2d1ipv6").
        Leases().Add().
        SetLeaseTime(3600)
      IaType := d1Dhcpv6ServerPool.IaType().Iata()
      IaType.
        SetStartAddress("2000:0:0:1::100").
        SetStep(1).
        SetSize(10).
        SetPrefixLen(64) 
  ```

* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: Support of Egress Flow tracking for multiple flows is added any location of supported fields upto 10 bits.
  - Supported fields are `ethernet.src/dst`, `vlan.id`, `vlan.priority`, `ipv4.src/dst`, `ipv4.precedence`, `ipv6.src/dst`, `ipv6.traffic_class`.
  ```go
    eth := flow.EgressPacket().Add().Ethernet()
    ipv4 := flow.EgressPacket().Add().Ipv4()
    ipv4Tag := ipv4.Dst().MetricTags().Add()
    ipv4Tag.SetName("flow_ipv4_dst")
    ipv4Tag.SetOffset(22)
    ipv4Tag.SetLength(10)
  ```

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for ISIS Simulated Topology. [More Details](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models/pull/327)
  - Configuration for ISIS attributes for newly introduced simulated routers are identical to configuration for currently supported directly connected emulated routers.
  -  `devices[i].ethernets[j].connection.simulated_link`​ is introduced to create a simulated ethernet connection to build a Simulated Topology.
  ```go
    simulatedRouterEthernet := simulatedRouter.Ethernets().Add().
                SetName("simRtrEth").
                SetMac("00:00:11:02:02:02")
    simulatedRouterEthernet.Connection().SimulatedLink().SetRemoteSimulatedLink("connRtrSimEth")

    connectedRouterSimulatedEthernet := connectedRouter.Ethernets().Add().
                SetName("connRtrSimEth").
                SetMac("00:00:01:01:01:01")
    connectedRouterSimulatedEthernet.Connection().SimulatedLink().SetRemoteSimulatedLink("simRtrEth")
  ```
  Note: `get_metrics/states` APIs are only applicable for the connected emulated routers and not for the simulated routers.

* <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400, Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for fetching `lldp_neighbors[i].custom_tlvs[j].information` as hex bytes using `get_states` API. [More details](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models/pull/392)
	
### Bug Fix(s)
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Issue is fixed where for certain scenarios such as retrieving large control capture buffer or fetching `get_metrics/states` for large amount of data results in errors similar to <i>"grpc: received message larger than max (7934807 vs. 4194304)"</i>. 
  - For such scenarios note that the grpc receive buffer on the client should also be locally increased if necessary from default value of 4 MB.

* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Issue is fixed for LLDP where, when multiple custom tlvs are configured to be sent, sometimes the bytes in the `information` field in the outgoing LLDP PDUs were corrupted.


#### Known Issues
* <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400</i></b>: When the DHCPv6 client type is configured as IANAPD, DHCPv6 Server `get_states` doesn't show IAPD addresses
* <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400</i></b>: When DHCPv6 Server is configured with multiple pools, The DHCPv6 clients are not accepting addresses from different pools.

# Release Features(s)

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for DHCPv6 client interfaces to be used as source/destination for device traffic.
  - In this the learned IPv6 address from the DHCPv6 server is automatically populated in `ipv6.src/dst` if the choice is set to auto.dhcp.
  ```go
    clientToServerFlow.SetName("ClientToServer").TxRx().Device().
    SetTxNames([]string{"DHCPv6ClientName"}).
    SetRxNames([]string{"DHCPv6ServerInterfaceName"})
    clientToServerFlow.Packet().Add().Ethernet()
    clientToServerFlowIp := clientToServerFlow.Packet().Add().Ipv6()
    clientToServerFlowIp.Src().Auto().Dhcp()
    
    serverToClientFlow.SetName("ServerToClient").TxRx().Device().
        SetTxNames([]string{"DHCPv6ServerInterfaceName"}).
        SetRxNames([]string{"DHCPv6ClientName"})
    serverToClientFlow.Packet().Add().Ethernet()
    serverToClientFlowIp := serverToClientFlow.Packet().Add().Ipv6()
    serverToClientFlowIp.Dst().Auto().Dhcp()
  ```
  Note: For DHCPv6 client to DHCPv6 server each flow supports only one source endpoint in tx_rx.device.tx_names, hence a separate flow has to be configured for each DHCPv6 client if packet[i].ipv6.src.auto.dhcp is set.

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for `devices[i].ethernets[j].dhcpv6_interfaces[k].options/options_request` and `devices[i].dhcp_server.ipv6_interfaces[j].options`.
  ```go
        // Configure a DHCPv6 Client
        dhcpv6Client := d1Eth1.Dhcpv6Interfaces().Add().
          SetName("DHCPv6-Client")
        
        .........

          Add().
          SetCode(88).
          SetData("enterprise")
        dhcpv6Client.Options().VendorInfo().AssociatedDhcpMessages().All()

        //option request
        dhcpv6Client.OptionsRequest().Request().Add().BootfileUrl()
        dhcpv6Client.OptionsRequest().Request().Add().Custom().SetType(3)
        dhcpv6Client.OptionsRequest().AssociatedDhcpMessages().All()

        // Configure a DHCPv6 Server
        dhcpv6Server := d2.DhcpServer().Ipv6Interfaces().Add().
          SetName("DHCPv6-Server")

        ............
        dhcpv6Server.Options().BootfileUrl().SetUrl("URL").AssociatedDhcpMessages().All()
	      dhcpv6Server.Options().Dns().SetPrimary("8::8").SecondaryDns().Add().SetIp("9::9")
  ```

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for `devices[i].dhcp_server.ipv6_interfaces[j].leases[k].ia_type.choice.iapd/ianapd`.
  ```go
        // Configure a DHCPv6 Server
        dhcpv6Server := d2.DhcpServer().Ipv6Interfaces().Add().
          SetName("DHCPv6-Server")

        dhcpv6ServerPool := dhcpv6Server.SetIpv6Name("p2d1ipv6").
          Leases().Add().
          SetLeaseTime(3600)
        IaType := dhcpv6ServerPool.IaType().Iapd()
        IaType.
          SetAdvertisedPrefixLen(64).
          SetStartPrefixAddress("2000:0:0:100::0").
          SetPrefixStep(1).
          SetPrefixSize(10)
  ```

* <b><i>Ixia-c</i></b>: Support added for sending Organizational tlvs in LLDP PDUs.
  ```go
    lldp := config.Lldp().Items()[0]

    orgInfos1 := lldp.OrgInfos().Add()
    orgInfos1.Information().SetInfo("AABB11")
    orgInfos1.SetOui("1abcdf").SetSubtype(1)
  ```
  Note: Received Organizational tlvs can be seen in the `get_states` response of `lldp_neighbors`.

          SetName("p1d1dhcpv61")

        dhcpv6client.IaType().Iata()
        dhcpv6client.DuidType().Llt()

        // Configure a DHCPv6 Server
        d1Dhcpv6Server := d2.DhcpServer().Ipv6Interfaces().Add().
          SetName("p2d1Dhcpv6Server1").

        d1Dhcpv6ServerPool := d1Dhcpv6Server.SetIpv6Name("p2d1ipv6").
          Leases().Add().
          SetLeaseTime(3600)

# Release Features(s)

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for new traffic applying infrastructure.
  - Instead of <b><i>"Failed to apply flow configurations due to: Please contact Ixia Support."</i></b> , 
    - In scenarios where underlying hardware module doesn't have the resources to apply the flow a proper error message such as <b><i>"Failed to apply flow configurations due to: Error  occurred for flow 'ipv6flowlabel': The Tx Ports of the flow do not support the combinations of fields and size of value lists configured. Please reduce the size of the value lists or/and fields with value lists configured or use a load module ( or variant) with more resources.​"</i></b> Based on this either test can be modified or appropriate load modules can be used for the test.
    - There were certain scenarios with large `values` in packet fields in the flows which were failing with above error inspite of being within the modules capabilities and can now be applied without any error.
  - Earlier configuration with multiples flows with large `values` in packet fields would fail with error as <b><i>"Failed to apply flow configurations due to: Traffic configuration exceeds port background memory size."</i></b>. This issue is also fixed with the upgrade to new traffic applying infrastructure.
  - Issue where  correct `values`/`increment`/`decrement` for `ethernet.src/dst` was not being transmitted on the wire is fixed.
  - In this new infrastructure, traffic will be directly applied to the hardware ports resulting in better performance on `set_transmit_state`.

* <b><i>gosnappi</i></b>: Client side file organization of the `gosnappi` sdk is modified to allow for better auto-completion support when writing test programs.
  Note: Client must be upgraded to gosnappi [v1.7.2](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-traffic-generator/snappi/gosnappi@v1.7.2).

* <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400</i></b>: Support added for DHCPv4 Client and Server in control plane. [details](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models/pull/371)
  - User will be the able to configure DHCPv4 Client and Server by the following code snippet. More comprehensive [B2B example](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/featureprofiles/blob/dev-dhcp/feature/dhcp/dhcpv4_client_server_b2b_test.go)
  ```go
    // Configure a DHCP Client
    dhcpclient := d1Eth1.Dhcpv4Interfaces().Add().
        SetName("p1d1dhcpv41")

    dhcpclient.FirstServer()
    dhcpclient.ParametersRequestList().
        SetSubnetMask(true).
        SetRouter(true).
        SetRenewalTimer(true)

  // Configure a DHCP Server
    d2Dhcpv4Server := d2.DhcpServer().Ipv4Interfaces().Add().
        SetName("p2d1dhcpv4server")

    d2Dhcpv4Server.SetIpv4Name("p2d1ipv4").AddressPools().
        Add().SetName("pool1").
        SetLeaseTime(3600).
        SetStartAddress("100.1.100.1").
        SetStep(1).
        SetCount(1).
        SetPrefixLength(16).Options().SetRouterAddress("100.1.0.1").SetEchoRelayWithTlv82(true)
  ```
* <b><i>Ixia-C, Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne), UHD400</i></b>: Support added for `random` in following flow fields. [details](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models/pull/380)
  - `ipv4.src​/dst`
  - `ipv6.flow_label​`
  - `tcp.src_port/dst_port`
  - `udp.src_port/dst_port`

    - User can configure by using following snippet.
      ```go
        ipv6 := flow1.Packet().Add().Ipv6()
        ipv6.FlowLabel().Random()​.SetMin(1).SetMax(1048574).SetCount(250000).SetSeed(1)
      ```
    Note: For <b><i>UHD400</i></b> an intermittent issue is present on using `random`, where `rx` fields of `flow_metrics` can return zero values.


* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: New environment variable `OPT_ADAPTIVE_CPU_USAGE=""` is introduced for docker based ixia-c-traffic-engine setups which enables adaptive CPU usage on the `rx` port for a flow. By default a non adaptive receiver is used when the `rx` CPU core usage reaches up to 100%. The adaptive receiver reduces `rx` CPU core usage from 100% to less than 5% in idle mode. To disable the adaptive receiver please remove this environment variable from docker run command. It is recommended to also pin the `rx` to specific cpu cores using the `ARG_CORE_LIST` environment variable when enabling `OPT_ADAPTIVE_CPU_USAGE`.

  - Example docker usage:

  ```yml
    docker run --net=host --privileged --rm -d \
      -e OPT_LISTEN_PORT="5555" \
      -e ARG_CORE_LIST="1 2 3" \
      -e ARG_IFACE_LIST="virtual@af_packet,enp7s0" \
      -e OPT_NO_HUGEPAGES="Yes" \
      -e OPT_ADAPTIVE_CPU_USAGE="" \
      --name ixia-c-traffic-engine \
      ixia-c-traffic-engine:1.8.0.25
  ```

### Bug Fix(s)
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Issue where `flow_metrics` were not being returned within timeout resulting in <b><i>"Could not send message, error: unexpected queue Get(1) error: queue: disposed" and "Stats may be inconsistent"</i></b> error is fixed.

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Issue where BGP/BGP+ learned information containing `origin` of type `incomplete` was not being returned properly by `get_states` is fixed. This would result in deserialization error while accessing BGP/BGP+ learned information using `otg-gNMI-server`.

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(AresOne)</i></b>: Issue where `port_metrics` were not available when load module of type `1 x 400G AresOne-M` with transceiver of type `800GE LAN QSFP-DD` was being used, is fixed.

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Issue where `set_control_state.protocol.route.state=withdraw/advertise` is triggered with an empty `names` field, all configured route ranges were being not withdrawn or advertised, is fixed.

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Issue where on `set_control_state.protocol.all.state=start`, a `l1` `up/down` event was triggered even when `l1` state was already `up`, is now fixed. 

  Note: If port is in `down` state, it has to be brought back to `up` state before starting a test.


#### Known Issues
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: If `keng-layer23-hw-server` version is upgraded/downgraded, the ports which will be used from this container must be rebooted once before running the tests.
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: `StartProtocols`/`set_control_state.protocol.all.start` can get stuck till the time all DHPCv4 clients receive the leased IPv4 addresses from the DHCPv4 server/relay agent. This may result in getting `"context deadline exceeded"` error in the test program.
* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: Packets will not be transmitted if `flows[i].rate.pps` is less than 50.
* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: `values` for fields in flow packet headers can be created with maximum length of 1000 values.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Flow Tx is incremented for flow with tx endpoints as LAG, even if no packets are sent on the wire when all active links of the LAG are down. 
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

# Release Features(s)
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for DHCPv4 client interfaces to be used as source/destination for device traffic.
  - In this the learned IPv4 address from the DHCPv4 server is automatically populated in `ipv4.src/dst` if the choice is set to `auto.dhcp`.

  ```go
    clientToServerFlow.SetName("ClientToServer").TxRx().Device().
    SetTxNames([]string{"DHCPv4ClientName"}).
    SetRxNames([]string{"DHCPv4ServerInterfaceName"})
    clientToServerFlowIp := clientToServerFlow.Packet().Add().Ipv4()
    clientToServerFlowIp.Src().Auto().Dhcp()
    
    serverToClientFlow.SetName("ServerToClient").TxRx().Device().
        SetTxNames([]string{"DHCPv4ServerInterfaceName"}).
        SetRxNames([]string{"DHCPv4ClientName"})
    serverToClientFlowIp := serverToClientFlow.Packet().Add().Ipv4()
    serverToClientFlowIp.Dst().Auto().Dhcp()
  ```
  Note: For DHCPv4 client to DHCPv4 server each flow supports only one source endpoint in `tx_rx.device.tx_names`, hence a separate flow has to be configured for each DHCPv4 client if `packet[i].ipv4.src.auto.dhcp` is set.

* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Support added for multiple address groups in BGPv4/v6 routes.
  ```go
    route = peer.V4Routes().Add().​
      SetNextHopIpv4Address("2.2.2.2").​
      SetName("peer1.rr1")​

    route.Addresses().Add().​
      SetAddress("20.20.20.1").SetPrefix(32).SetCount(2).SetStep(2)​

    route.Addresses().Add().​
      SetAddress("20.20.21.1").SetPrefix(32).SetCount(2).SetStep(2)​
  ```

### Bug Fix(s)
* <b><i>Ixia-C, Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Issue where if a BGPv4/v6 prefix with extended-community or community attributes was updated via a BGP Update with the extended-community or community attribute deleted without a Route Withdraw in between , the subsequent get_states call on the bgp prefixes would incorrectly continue to show the extended-community or community attributes learned via the previous received Update is fixed.

* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Issue where If a test was setup such that only test port would initiate ARP/ND and time taken to configure the soft-DUT connected to the test port was taking extended time such that it would not respond to ARP/ND requests within 10s, ARP/ND procedures would fail resulting in test failures in ARP/ND verification step is fixed.

* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Issue where if a IPv6 address on the emulated interface was configured in non-shortest format e.g.  `2001:0db8::192:0:2:2` instead of `2001:db8::192:0:2:2` (notice the redundant leading 0 in :0db8), the test port would not initiate IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for corresponding IPv6 gateway result in Neighbor Discovery failure is fixed.

* <b><i>Keng-Operator</i></b>: Some fixes are provided to handle security warnings raised by k8s security scanning tool such as <i>`'container "manager" in Deployment "ixiatg-op-controller-manager" does not set readOnlyRootFilesystem: true in its securityContext. This setting is encouraged because it can prevent attackers from writing malicious binaries into runnable locations in the container filesystem.'`</i>.

* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: Issue is fixed where `frames_rx` is reported twice of `frames_tx` in `flow_metrics` is fixed.


#### Known Issues
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: If `keng-layer23-hw-server` version is upgraded/downgraded, the ports which will be used from this container must be rebooted once before running the tests.
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: `StartProtocols`/`set_control_state.protocol.all.start` can get stuck till the time all DHPCv4 clients receive the leased IPv4 addresses from the DHCPv4 server/relay agent. This may result in getting `"context deadline exceeded"` error in the test program.

### Bug Fix(s)
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Issue where withdrawing BGP/BGP+ routes using `set_control_state.protocol.route.withdraw` was failing in multi-nic topology is fixed.
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(AresOne)</i></b>: Issue where after running BGP/BGP+ tests on multi-nic ports would result intermittently in `context deadline` errors for subsequent tests/sub tests is fixed.
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Issue where after running tests involving continuous connect/reconnect of test ports for long duration (e.g. 2 - 3 hrs) would result in intermittent `context deadline` errors for a bunch of consecutive tests is fixed.


#### Known Issues
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: If `keng-layer23-hw-server` version is upgraded/downgraded, the ports which will be used from this container must be rebooted once before running the tests.
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: `StartProtocols`/`set_control_state.protocol.all.start` can get stuck till the time all DHPCv4 clients receive the leased IPv4 addresses from the DHCPv4 server/relay agent.

# Release Features(s)
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for DHCPv4 Client and Server in control plane. [details](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models/pull/371)
  - User will be the able to configure DHCPv4 Client and Server by the following code snippet. More comprehensive [B2B example](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/featureprofiles/blob/dev-dhcp/feature/dhcp/dhcpv4_client_server_b2b_test.go) 
  ```go
    // Configure a DHCP Client
      dhcpclient := d1Eth1.Dhcpv4Interfaces().Add().
          SetName("p1d1dhcpv41")
  
      dhcpclient.FirstServer()
      dhcpclient.ParametersRequestList().
          SetSubnetMask(true).
          SetRouter(true).
          SetRenewalTimer(true)

    // Configure a DHCP Server
      d2Dhcpv4Server := d2.DhcpServer().Ipv4Interfaces().Add().
          SetName("p2d1dhcpv4server")
  
      d2Dhcpv4Server.SetIpv4Name("p2d1ipv4").AddressPools().
          Add().SetName("pool1").
          SetLeaseTime(3600).
          SetStartAddress("100.1.100.1").
          SetStep(1).
          SetCount(1).
          SetPrefixLength(16).Options().SetRouterAddress("100.1.0.1").SetEchoRelayWithTlv82(true)
  ``` 

* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: gNMI support added to fetch DHCPv4 Client and Server statistics. 
  - [DHCPv4 Client](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models-yang/blob/main/artifacts/open-traffic-generator-dhcpv4client.txt)

  ```gNMI
    # Combined metrics and states information
    dhcpv4-clients/dhcpv4-client[name=clientName]/state

    # Metrics information 
    dhcpv4-clients/dhcpv4-client[name=clientName]/state/counters

    # States information
    dhcpv4-clients/dhcpv4-client[name=clientName]/state/interface
  ```
  - [DHCPv4 Server](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models-yang/blob/main/artifacts/open-traffic-generator-dhcpv4server.txt)

  ```gNMI
    # Combined metrics and states information
    dhcpv4-servers/dhcpv4-servers[name=serverName]/state

    # Metrics information
    dhcpv4-servers/dhcpv4-servers[name=serverName]/state/counters
    
    # States information
    dhcpv4-servers/dhcpv4-servers[name=serverName]/state/leases (For now it will return empty responses.)
  ```
    Note: Support for `GetStates`/`dhcpv4-servers/dhcpv4-servers[name=serverName]/state/leases` of DHCP Server will be provided in subsequent release. 

### Bug Fix(s)
* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: An issue has been fixed where, Despite proper ARP resolution, packets of `flows` of type `device` might not get forwarded by the DUT, resulting in 0 `rx` statistics.
  This issue is visible for UHD400/ixia-c releases up to `v1.5.0-1`.


#### Known Issues
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: `set_control_state.protocol.all.start` can get stuck till the time all DHPCv4 clients receive the leased IPv4 addresses from the DHCPv4 server/relay agent. This may result in getting `"context deadline exceeded"` error in the test program.
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: If `keng-layer23-hw-server` version is upgraded/downgraded, the ports which will be used from this container must be rebooted once before running the tests.
* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: Packets will not be transmitted if `flows[i].rate.pps` is less than 50.
* <b><i>UHD400</i></b>: `values` for fields in flow packet headers can be created with maximum length of 1000 values.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Flow Tx is incremented for flow with tx endpoints as LAG, even if no packets are sent on the wire when all active links of the LAG are down. 
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

# Bug Fix(s)
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: An issue has been detected whereby some internal certificates used in the ixia-c containerized solution has expired. <b><i>This is fixed in this patch build.</i></b>

  The most common manifestation of this is that despite proper ARP resolution, Traffic Start in tests will fail in combined protocol-engine/traffic-engine setups with `Error occurred while starting flows: [error starting tx port <portname>: unsuccessful Response: MAC address resolution failed for IP: <ip address>  ]`.

  <b><i>This issue should not affect standalone traffic-engine setups using 'port' or raw traffic flows.</i></b>

  This issue is visible for ixia-c community releases starting from `v0.1.0-3` to `v1.4.0-15`.



#### Known Issues

# Release Features(s)
* <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400, Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: Support added for BGP/BGP+ peers to use `custom` ports instead of default `179` tcp port.
  - Listen Port - TCP port number on which to accept BGP/BGP+ connections from the remote peer.
  - Neighbor Port - Destination TCP port number to be used by the BGP/BGP+ peer when initiating a session to the remote peer. 
  ```go
    bgpPeer.Advanced().SetListenPort(55555)
    bgpPeer.Advanced().SetNeighborPort(55555)
  ```
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Support added to enable/disable BGP/BGP+ peers on the fly.
  ```go
    s := gosnappi.NewControlState().               ​
        SetChoice(gosnappi.ControlStateChoice.PROTOCOL)​
    bgpPeers := s.Protocol().Bgp().Peers()        ​
    bgpPeers.SetPeerNames(peerNames).​
    SetState(gosnappi.StateProtocolBgpPeersState.UP/DOWN)​
    _ , err := client.Api().SetControlState(s)​
  ```
* Public API in `gosnappi` SDK has been cleaned up and refactored. [PR with the details](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/snappi/pull/214)
  - `GosnappiApi` interface is now renamed to `Api` interface.
  - All public methods for creation of structs are now removed from `GosnappiApi` interface.
  - There were helper methods defined on each struct which have been reorganized or hidden.
  - Choice setter `SetChoice()` has been made private and is now implicitly set based on the `choice` property set by the user.
  - Impact on backward compatibility:
    - Updating of gosnappi to `0.13.4` or higher will need change of test programs/implementations utilizing `gosnappi` SDK.
    - If gosnappi is not updated on the client current tests will continue to work with new `keng-controller:0.1.0-158`.

# Bug Fix(s)
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: If a port was in link down state, the state was not being cleared on fresh `SetConfig` for `AresOne` ports and `Novus100G` mode, affecting future tests. This issue is fixed.



#### Known Issues
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: If `keng-layer23-hw-server` version is upgraded/downgraded, the ports which will be used from this container must be rebooted once before running the tests.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Flow Tx is incremented for flow with tx endpoints as LAG, even if no packets are sent on the wire when all active links of the LAG are down. 
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

# Release Features(s)
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Support added to trigger link `up/down` on test ports using the API `set_control_state.port.link`. This applicable only when the test port is directly connected to device under test via `veth` connection, e.g in KNE single node cluster, containerlab.
  ```go
    portStateAction := gosnappi.NewControlState()
    linkState := portStateAction.Port().Link().
                    SetPortNames([]string{port.Name()}).
                    SetState(gosnappi.StatePortLinkState.DOWN/UP)
    api.SetControlState(portStateAction)
  ```
  - It removes the deviation (`deviation_ate_port_link_state_operations_unsupported`) which was added in `featuresprofile` tests for no supporting the LinkState trigger in <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>.


#### Known Issues

# Release Features(s)
* Support for BGP/BGP+ passive mode <b><i>Ixia-C, UHD400 and Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>. If `passive_mode` of a peer is set to true, it will wait for the remote peer to initiate the BGP session.
  - User needs to set `devices[i].bgp.ipv4/v6_interfaces[j].peers[k].advance.passive_mode` to `true` for enabling passive mode.

* When `layer1[i].speed` is not explicitly set, the current speed of underlying test interface shall be assumed.
  - This allows setting of `layer1` MTU in tests to run on  setups with different port speeds on <b><i>Ixia-C and Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b> without any modifications.
    ```go
      otgConfig.Layer1().Add().
          SetName("layerOne").
          SetPortNames(portNames).
          SetMtu(9000)
    ```
  - For traffic with `flow.rate.percentage` specified and `layer1[i].speed` not specified, the rate is now automatically calculated based on the port speed of the port from where traffic is being transmitted.

# Bug Fix(s)
* Issue where `devices[i].bgp.ipv4/v6_interfaces[j].peers[k].v4/v6_routes[m].communities` was not being sent properly for <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b> is now fixed.


#### Known Issues
* <b><i>Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)</i></b>: If `keng-layer23-hw-server` version is upgraded/downgraded, the ports which will be used from this container must be rebooted once before running the tests.
* <b><i>Ixia-C</i></b>: Flow Tx is incremented for flow with tx endpoints as LAG, even if no packets are sent on the wire when all active links of the LAG are down.

> The container image paths have changed for some Ixia-C artifacts. Please review **Build Details** for correct paths.

#### Bug Fix(s)
* Memory leak in **Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)** is fixed for long duration tests.
* `gosnappi` now correctly validates required primitive types when they're not explicitly set by users.
* IS-IS metric is no longer sent as 63 when configured as 200 (or more than 63) with wide metrics enabled on **Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne)**.


#### Known Issues
* If `keng-layer23-hw-server` version is upgraded/downgraded, the ports from Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne) which will be used from this container must be rebooted once before running the tests.
* Adding more than 256 devices on a single ixia-c-port causing failure for Ixia Chassis & Appliances(Novus, AresOne).
* Flow Tx is incremented for flow with tx endpoints as LAG, even if no packets are sent on the wire when all active links of the LAG are down.
* With certain DUTs, ssh service hangs if ISIS L1 MD5 is enabled.
* Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

# Release Feature(s)
* Support for deprecated control, action and update APIs (`set_transmit_state`, `set_link_state`, `set_capture_state`, `update_flows`, `set_route_state`, `send_ping`, `set_protocol_state`, `set_device_state`) have been removed. Please use following `set_control_state`, `set_control_action` and `update_config` APIs instead of the previous ones. Please refer to [go utils](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/conformance/commit/ecffd7edf93a4e60105a263cc7a074e2abe26ae4#diff-2f28df5cf5ed455b[…]c48b9ac5ef7ac25e5a018a) and [python utils](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/conformance/commit/ecffd7edf93a4e60105a263cc7a074e2abe26ae4#diff-205d55e3f01484e637c6b5b597a6dfb44e74638964605a23b20d5fa72e773a38) for further details usage.
* Most properties in OTG with integer data type have been assigned correct integer format (from `uint32`, `uint64`, `int32` and `int64`). Please [click here](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models/pull/301) to examine all changes.
* Once you upgrade the new ixia-c release, in addition to removing the deprecated APIs from the test programs, data types of some variables in the test programs might need to be changed to avoid compilation errors.


#### Known Issues
* Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

# Release Feature(s)
* Enabling `metric_tags` for egress tracking is now also supported on ipv6.src/dst, ipv6.traffic_class, ipv6.flow_label and ipv6.payload_length. <b><i>[Ixia-C]</i></b>
  ```go
    eth := flow.EgressPacket().Add().Ethernet()
    ipv6 := flow.EgressPacket().Add().Ipv6()
    ipv6Tag := ipv6.Dst().MetricTags().Add()
    ipv6Tag.SetName("flow_ipv6_dst")
    ipv6Tag.SetOffset(120)
    ipv6Tag.SetLength(8)
  ```
* Support is available in gNMI to fetch the drill-down statistics for egress tracking as follows <b><i>[Ixia-C]</i></b> [details](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/models-yang/blob/main/artifacts/open-traffic-generator-flow.txt):
    ```
      1. Flow level metrics + Tagged Metrics:
          example path: "flows/flow[name=f1]“
      2. Only Flow level metrics:
          example path: "flows/flow[name=f1]/state“
      3. Only Tagged metrics 
          example path: "flows/flow[name=f1]/tagged-metrics“
      4. Filtered Tagged metrics: 
          example path: "flows/flow[name=f1]/tagged-metrics/tagged-metric[name-value-pairs=flow_ipv6_dst=0x2]”
    ```
# Bug Fix(s)
* For `flow.duration.continuous` type of traffic in Ixia-C, intermittent issue where last few packets in a traffic flow were not accounted for in `flow_metrics.frames_rx` statistics after stopping a flow is fixed.
* Proper error mesage is propagated to user if user has used community edition of Ixia-C (instead of licensed edition) and invoked any API/Configuration not supported by it.
  example: `Device configuration is not supported in free version of controller.`

#### Known Issues
* Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

# Release Features(s)
* Support added for weighted pairs for packet size distribution in traffic flows.
  - `predefined` packet size distributions supported are `imix`, `ipsec_imix`, `ipv6_imix`, `standard_imix`, `tcp_imix`. It can be configured as follows:
    ```go 
      myFlow.Size().WeightPairs().SetPredefined(gosnappi.FlowSizeWeightPairsPredefined.IMIX)
    ```
  - Custom packet size distribution is also supported. It can configured as follows,
    ```go
      customWeightPairs := myFlow.Size().WeightPairs().Custom()
      customWeightPairs.Add().SetSize(64).SetWeight(7)
      customWeightPairs.Add().SetSize(570).SetWeight(4)
      customWeightPairs.Add().SetSize(1518).SetWeight(1)
    ```
* Support is added for egress tracking based on IPv4 total length.

 
#### Known Issues
* Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

# Release Features(s)
* A new property `egress_packet` inside flow has been introduced to configure expected packet shape as it is received on the test port.
      ```go
        eth := flow.EgressPacket().Add().Ethernet()
        ipv4 := flow.EgressPacket().Add().Ipv4()
      ```
* A new property `metric_tags` has been introduced for fields inside headers configured in `egress_packet` to enable tracking metrics for each applicable value corresponding to a portion of or all bits inside the field.
    ```go
      ipv4Tag := ipv4.Dst().MetricTags().Add()
      ipv4Tag.SetName("flow_ipv4_dst")
      ipv4Tag.SetOffset(24)
      ipv4Tag.SetLength(8)
    ```
   -  As of this release, enabling metric_tags is only supported on ethernet.src/dst, ipv4.src/dst, ipv4.tos. Support for more fields shall be added in upcoming releases.

  - Limitations:
    - The total number of tracking bits available on an ixia-c Rx port is 12 bits. Out of these some of the bits are needed for tracking flows, example 2 flows need 1 bit, 4 flows need 2 bits, 8 flows need 3 bits etc. The sum of `metric_tag.length` for each field inside each header configured in `egress_packet` cannot exceed the remaining bits available on the Rx port.
    - The total number of tracking fields that can be configured across a set of flows which have the same Rx port, is two.

* A new property is introduced in `get_metrics.flow` to fetch tagged metrics.
 - User can set `get_metrics.flow.tagged_metrics.include=false` not to include `tagged_metrics` in the `flow_metrics` response. 
 - Specific `tagged_metrics` can be fetched by setting `get_metrics.flow.tagged_metrics.filters[i].name`.
 
#### Known Issues
* Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

### Features(s)
* Warning messages shall now be automatically printed on STDOUT if a property or an API with status deprecated or under-review is exercised in `snappi` / `gosnappi`. This may also lead to linters raising deprecation error.
* New API endpoints `/control/state` and `/control/action` have been exposed consolidating pre-existing API endpoints inside `/control/` (now deprecated) in order to reduce API surface and introducing clean organization. Please see [snappi-tests utils](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/snappi-tests/blob/main/tests/utils/common.py) for usage.
* API endpoints `/results/*` have now been renamed to `/monitor/*` .


#### Known Issues
* Supported value for `flows[i].metrics.latency.mode` is `cut_through`.
* The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.
* When flow transmit is started, transmission will be restarted on any existing flows already transmitting packets.

#### New Feature(s)

* Correct received(rx) rate statistics support is incorporated as part of port metrics.
    * `frames_rx_rate`
    * `bytes_rx_rate`

* [Breaking Change] Auto learning of destination MAC is currently supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 Flows without any VLAN(originated from device endpoints) by setting ethernet destination with `choice` as `auto` in the packet. Earlier this was working by setting ethernet destination mac with "00:00:00:00:00:00" in the packet header.
    ```
        {
            "choice": "ethernet",
            "ethernet": {
                "dst": {
                    "choice": "auto"
                },
                "src": {
                    "choice": "value",
                    "value": "00:00:01:01:01:01"
                }
            }
        },
    ````

#### Known Issues

#### New Feature(s)

* Flow header configuration for protocols `GRE` and `VXLAN (RFC 2784)` are now supported.
* Flow metrics is now disabled by default to allow transmitting packets with `unaltered payload `(i.e. without any timestamps and instrumentation bytes embedded in it).
* Flow metrics (including metrics that are its sub-properties, e.g. `latency` and `timestamp`) can now be explicitly enabled on per-flow basis.

#### Bug Fixes

* `ixia-c-controller` can now safely serve multiple parallel requests from different clients preventing any undefined behavior.
* Port metrics can now be fetched for ports which are not part of flow configuration.
* Providing port locations for `ixia-c-traffic-engine` running in unsupported mode will now throw a user-friendly error.
* Default values for `increment` and `decrement` properties in flow header fields are now aligned per Open Traffic Generator API.

#### Known Issues

* Checksum field in `GRE` header currently cannot be set.
* The metric `loss` in flow metrics is currently not supported.

#### Bug Fixes

* The flow configuration parameter `inter_burst_gap` when specified in nanoseconds can now be set to a value larger than 4.2 seconds.
* Invalid values can now be set for the `phb` (per hob behavior) field in the DSCP bits in the IPv4 header.
* The `set_config` method will return an error when flows are over subscribed.
* Fixed an error in calculation for packet counts when `duration` is set in terms of fixed_seconds.

#### Known Issues

* The metrics `frames_rx_rate` and `bytes_rx_rate` in port statistics are not calculated correctly and are always zero.
* The metric `min_latency_ns` in flow statistics is not calculated correctly and is always zero.
