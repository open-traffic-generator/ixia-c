Ixia Operator first tries to access these details from Keysight published releases; if unable to so, it tries to locate them in Kubernetes configmap. This allows users to have the operator load images from private repositories, by updating the configmap entries. Thus, for deployment with custom images, the user is expected to download release specific ixia-configmap.yaml from published releases. Then, in the configmap, update the specific container image \"path\" / \"tag\" fields and also update the \"release\" to some custom name.

[snappi](https://github.com/open-traffic-generator/snappi) is a *Pythonic* client library that can be used to write tests that run against Ixia-c.  The following two diagrams illustrate this relationship.    Where can I find a tutorial on snappi?    The [Hello snappi](hello-snappi.md) tutorial is a good starting point to get familiar with `snappi`.   How to use other non-Python clients?    TODO: Fill in details here.

The `info` section contains the `version` of the Open Traffic Generator Data Model implemented by the KENG controller."},{"location":"faq/#packets","title":"Packets","text":"What do packets look like?    Ixia packet testers utilize a proprietary flow-tracking technique which involves inserting a special *instrumentation header* into the packet.  It is inserted after the last valid protocol header ie, in the payload.     The fields in this header are:  - a *signature* which servers as marker to indicate start of header - a *PGID* or *port group id* field to distinguish between different flows - a 32 bit *sequence number* that can be used to detect packet re-ordering - a 32 bit timestamp that can be used to measure one-way latency    How do I disable packet instrumentation?    According to the Open Traffic Generator data model packet instrumentation is enabled by default on all the flows.  It is not possible to disable it at the moment.  An update to the data model that allows the end user to disable instrumentation is in the process of being merged into the *main* branch and will be submitted in the coming weeks.  Ixia-c will implement it at that point.    Does Ixia-c calculate packet checksums?  If so, which ones?    Yes, the Ixia-c traffic-engine automatically calculates the Ethernet FCS, IPv4, TCP and UDP checksums.  The traffic-engine is capable of calculating *four* checksums (in each packet).  TODO: verify.   What layer1 settings does Ixia-c utilize?    The only `layer1` setting that is used by the Ixia-c traffic engine is `speed`.  This setting is used to help convert flow rate specified as *percentage line-rate* into packets/second (pps) and to ensure that proper inter-packet-gaps are used.   What is the purpose of the layer1 setting speed?    To calculate packets/second (pps) when the flow rate is specified as *percentage line-rate* and to ensure proper inter-packet-gaps."},{"location":"faq/#application-usage-reporter","title":"Application Usage Reporter","text":"What is Application Usage Reporter?

The license check-out/check-in mechanism in the keng-controller works as follows:  1. Calculate the Test Cost. For example,  Test Cost = N. 2. Based on the calculation performed in step (1), check-out the licenses at the time of the OTG SetConfig API call. 3. Execute the test if license check-out is successful. 4. For the next configuration, calculate Test Cost, For example, Test Cost = M. <pre><code>if M == N:\n    - keng-controller will not have any communication with license servers\nelse if M &gt; N:\n    - keng-controller will not check-in licenses\n    - it will attempt to check-out required additional licenses\nelse if M &lt; N:\n    - keng-controller will check-in surplus of the licenses\n</code></pre> Does licensing have impact on API response time?  On the timing aspect, the entire license check-out/check-in mechanism works concurrently with the control plane and the data plane configurations in the ports during the OTG SetConfig operation. Therefore, potentially there is a minimal impact in the OTG SetConfig API response time. If the license server is on a remote site from the controller, the OTG SetConfig API response time might get impacted due to the network latency.  What happens if license servers are not available?  The keng-controller can work with up to 4 license servers. The controller tries to connect to all the license servers during the startup. If none of them is available, the controller capabilities are reduced to the Community Edition. After that, a background routine is initiated to make recurrent attempts to connect the configured license servers in 30 second intervals.   Once the controller is able to establish a connection with any of the license servers, for any new configuration beyond capabilities of the Community Edition, the keng-controller will try to check-out a license from the license server with which the connection is established.  What is the message generated when the license server is not available?  When a configured license server is not reachable, the log message with error code 13 is generated by the keng-controller:  \"level\":\"warn\",\"ctx\":\"impl/licensing\",\"Not all license server could be reached\":\"code: 13 ...error details... \"  What is the error generated when a license cannot be checked out?  There are two possible scenarios when the license cannot checkout.  Scenario 1: Any of the license servers does not have the adequate license features that are required for the test configuration. It will throw an error with the error code 13 and the following error message:  Current configuration requires following additional license feature(s): {...details...} which is not available in configured license server(s): {...details...} Available license feature(s) in license-server(s) are {...details...}.   Scenario 2: Previously active license server is no longer available/reachable. It will throw an error with the error code 13 and the following error message:  issue consuming license from server ...address...: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded  After how many retries things are considered dead and how long does it take?  The controller will keep probing the list of license servers that are supplied at the time in the background routine in every 30 seconds during the controller lifetime.  What happens if the controller can't check-out the license for a specific server?  The keng-controller will attempt to check out licenses from the next available license server in the configured list.  How long does a license remain checked-out?  For the duration of the current test configuration, the license will remain checked-out. Once the new test configuration is applied that doesn't require the license, the license will be checked-in.  How to check-in all the licenses?  To check-in all the licenses, apply an empty configuration. Alternatively, gracefully stop the keng-controller container.  What happens of the controller can't check-in the license back?  There is a keep-alive mechanism between the controller and the license server. If the controller crashes, is forcefully stopped, or lost the connection to the license server, the licenses will be automatically checked-in after 5 minutes of keep-alive inactivity."},{"location":"reference/resource-requirements/","title":"Resource requirement","text":"<p>The minimum memory and cpu requirements for each Ixia-c components are captured in the following table.
